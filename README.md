# QR Converter 📱💬

Welcome to QR Converter! This project aims to provide a convenient tool for converting text to QR codes and vice versa. It utilizes the [GoQR API](https://goqr.me/api/) for text to QR code conversion and provides options for both uploading a file using [react-qr-code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qr-reader) and scanning from a webcam for QR code to text conversion.
